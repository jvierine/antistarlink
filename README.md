# Plasma-parameter estimation tools

This repository contains a set of tools for incoherent scatter radar plasma-parameter analysis. Quite many measures are taken in order to mitigate space object contamination and radio interference. There is a lag-profile inversion based on sparse matrix libraries for high SNR measurements that often get you well into the top-side of the ionosphere, and a range-Doppler based fitter for top-side plasma-parameters. 

The word of warning: code is still being developed and tested.
